We are happy to share our 2023 roadmap with our community. 2022 has been a fantastic year for us. Our team has steadily grown, and a lot of lessons & to learn for us to continue to iterate our protocol. 

We have finally migrated our documentation to this framework and hope to share updates more frequently with you. Next year, we will also do more community engagement. If you are interested in building some cool apps using ZK and reputation as core, Unirep protocol is right here for you.

Enough said. Here is our roadmap for 2023, [have a look.](https://pse-team.notion.site/UniRep-Roadmap-2023-a7a1aa6a66134d12b97b022c45cbdd81)
