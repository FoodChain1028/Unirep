# Users and Attesters

## Actors in Unirep

### Users ðŸ‘¤
**receive reputation** from attesters and are able to **prove received reputation**.

* Users sign up by calling `userSignUp` on the Unirep contract with a signup proof.
* Users' `identityCommitment` is revealed at this time and recorded in the contract to prevent double signup.
* The identity commitment does not reveal the actual `identity` of the user but allows the user to prove their identity in the circuit.

### Attesters ðŸ‘‘
can be thought of as `applications`. Attesters define their own reputation systems and are able to **give attestations** to users, which become the users' reputation.

* Attesters sign up by calling `attesterSignUp` on the Unirep contract.
* Attesters are given an `attesterId` that is their contract address.
* Attester information and attestation history are _public_; everyone can see each attestation and which attester submitted it to the Unirep contract.
